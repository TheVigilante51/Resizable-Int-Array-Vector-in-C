# Resizable-Int-Array-Vector-in-C
A resizable int array written entirely in C (other resizable arrays are coming soon) 
<br />This is just a basic resizable array and I don't wish to make it more advanced other than for learning purposes because it would be like re-inventing the wheel
<br /> To compile it run `gcc .\main.c .\Vector_Int.c -o output.exe` in the terminal of your choice.
<br /> Then run `.\output.exe`
<br />
